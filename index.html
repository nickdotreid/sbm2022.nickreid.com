				Thank you for visiting my SBM 2022 Poster <em>(website)</em>
			</h2>
			<p>The work presented at SBM 2022 was part of a larger project, <a href="https://takeontransplant.org/">Take on Transplant</a> to develop an educational resource for people living with cystic fibrosis to learn about lung transplant. Most of this work isn't published, so email me to learn more. <a href="mailto:nickreid@uw.edu">(nickreid@uw.edu)</a></p>
			<p>My personal goal with this work is to explore decision support at different points in the illness trajectory</p>
			<p>The submitted <a href="/reid-sbm-2022-abstract.pdf">abstract PDF is here,</a> and as text below.</p>
